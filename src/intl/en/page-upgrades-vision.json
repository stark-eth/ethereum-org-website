  "page-upgrades-vision-scalability": "Scalability",
  "page-upgrades-vision-scalability-desc": "Ethereum needs to be able to handle more transactions per second without increasing the size of the nodes in the network. Nodes are vital network participants who store and run the blockchain. Increasing node size isn't practical because only those with powerful and expensive computers could do it. To scale, Ethereum needs more transactions per second, coupled with more nodes. More nodes means more security.",
  "page-upgrades-vision-scalability-desc-3": "Sharding upgrades will spread the data storage requirements across the entire network, no longer requiring every node to hold 100% of the data. Although this doesn't directly address scaling the execution of transactions, this problem is being addressed directly by <a href=\"/layer-2/\">layer 2</a> rollup solutions.",
  "page-upgrades-vision-scalability-desc-4": "Rollups need cheap storage on layer 1 though to be most effective. Sharding will give Ethereum room to breathe by maximizing the efficiency on rollups, enabling exponential improvements beyond the current 15-45 transactions per second limit.",
  "page-upgrades-vision-security": "Security",
  "page-upgrades-vision-security-desc": "The planned upgrades improve Ethereum's security against coordinated attacks.",
  "page-upgrades-vision-security-desc-3": "In proof-of-stake additional security comes from greater crypto-economic disincentives against attack. This is because, in proof-of-stake, the validators who secure the network must stake significant amounts of ETH into the protocol. If they try and attack the network, the protocol can automatically destroy their ETH.",
  "page-upgrades-vision-security-desc-5": "However, it is also important that upgrades that protect validators against denial-of-service attacks, enhance their anonymity, and separate block building and block propagation are implemented soon. These upgrades protect individual validators and the network as a whole against liveness attacks and censorship.",
  "page-upgrades-vision-security-desc-5-link": "More on proof-of-stake",
  "page-upgrades-vision-security-desc-8": "Ethereum's security model also enables sharding. Validators who will be responsible for asserting that all data has been made available, but individual nodes will no longer be required to hold the entire history of the chain. A new role is also anticipated, known as a dedicated block builder, who will work alongside block proposers (validators) for efficient and safe block production",
  "page-upgrades-vision-security-desc-10": "Staking also means you don't need to invest in elite hardware to participate directly in consensus. This should encourage more people to become a validator, increasing the network's decentralization and decreasing the attack surface area.",

  "page-upgrades-vision-sustainability": "Sustainability",
  "page-upgrades-vision-sustainability-desc-1": "Ethereum is now a green blockchain. The energy consumption was reduced by ~99.95% when proof-of-work was swapped for proof-of-stake.",
  "page-upgrades-vision-sustainability-desc-2": "Ethereum is now secured via staking, not computing power.",
  "page-upgrades-vision-sustainability-desc-3": "This sustainability boost also brings security benefits - staked ether makes it much more expensive to attack the chain than under proof-of-work, but less expensive to secure it as less new ETH has to be issued to pay validators than miners.",
  "page-upgrades-vision-sustainability-desc-8": "The move to proof-of-stake made Ethereum greener and more secure. It is a low-carbon platform for building apps and organizations.",

  "page-upgrades-vision-title-3": "Too much energy",
  "page-upgrades-vision-trilemma-cardtext-1": "Ethereum upgrades will make Ethereum scalable, secure, and decentralized. Sharding will make Ethereum more scalable by increasing transactions per second while decreasing the power needed to run a node and validate the chain. The Beacon Chain will make Ethereum secure by coordinating validators across a sharded set of data. And staking will lower the barrier to participation and limit economies-of-scale, creating a larger - more decentralized - network.",
  "page-upgrades-vision-trilemma-cardtext-2": "Secure and decentralized blockchain networks require every node to verify every transaction processed by the chain. This amount of work limits the number of transactions that can happen at any one given time. Decentralized and secure reflects the Ethereum chain today.",
  "page-upgrades-vision-trilemma-cardtext-3": "Decentralized networks work by sending information about transactions across nodes - the whole network needs to know about any state change. Scaling transactions per second across a decentralized network poses security risks because the more transactions, the longer the delay, the higher the probability of attack while information is in flight.",
  "page-upgrades-vision-trilemma-cardtext-4": "Increasing the size and power of Ethereum's nodes could increase transactions per second in a secure way, but the hardware requirement would restrict who could do it - this threatens decentralization. It's hoped that sharding and proof-of-stake will allow Ethereum to scale by increasing the amount of nodes, not node size.",

  "page-upgrades-vision-trilemma-modal-tip": "Tap the circles below to better understand the problems of decentralized scaling",
  "page-upgrades-vision-trilemma-p": "A naive way to solve Ethereum's problems would be to make it more centralized. But decentralization is too important. It's decentralization that gives Ethereum neutrality, censorship resistance, openness, data ownership and near-unbreakable security.",
  "page-upgrades-vision-trilemma-p-1": "Ethereum's vision is to be more scalable and secure, but also to remain decentralized. Achieving these 3 qualities is a problem known as the scalability trilemma.",

  "page-upgrades-vision-upgrade-needs-desc-2": "High demand is driving up transaction fees that make Ethereum expensive for the average user. The disk space needed to run an Ethereum client is growing at a fast rate. And the underlying proof-of-work consensus algorithm that keeps Ethereum secure and decentralized has a big environmental impact.",
  "page-upgrades-vision-upgrade-needs-desc-3": "Ethereum has a set of upgrades that address these problems and more. This set of upgrades was originally called 'Serenity' and 'Eth2,' and they've been an active area of research and development since 2014.",
  "page-upgrades-vision-upgrade-needs-desc-5": "Now that the technology is ready, these upgrades will re-architect Ethereum to make it more scalable, secure, and sustainable - to make life better for existing users and entice new ones. All while preserving Ethereum's core value of decentralization.",
